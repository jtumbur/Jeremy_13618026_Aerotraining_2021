Then for numbers which is not valid for the previous constraints, using elif to find numbers that are multiple of 3 to be replaced with \"Fizz\". Third, do the same as step 2 but with constraint numbers multiple of 5 to print \"Buzz\"."

    "A palindrome is a sequence of characters that read the same backward as forward, in this problem is limited to alphanumeric case. First, store input from the user into a string. Second, calculate the length of the input. Third, match the character betweeen the foremost and the last. Next, progress to the second character and the second last character until the characters run out.
